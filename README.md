Louise, my research shows that the majority of campaigns for theater were successful in terms of reaching their goal. I would also suggest starting your campaign in May, since this is the time of year when campaigns are most successful. Lastly, I would set your goal just under $4,000 which is just below the average of what most campaigns cost. Best of luck!!!
